# Dotfiles

[Stowable](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) dotfiles themed with Gruvbox. Fonts are optimized for FHD displays.

### Shell
Most env-vars are host specific afterall, therefore not part of this repo.

### Sway
There should be a file `~/.sway/config` which includes `~/.config/sway/config` and sets host specific options like display resolutions.

### Gtk
[Gruvbox](https://github.com/Fausto-Korpsvart/Gruvbox-GTK-Theme) theme.
